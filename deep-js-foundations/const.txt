"const" variable has nothing to do with the value. 
	It has to do with the assignment. 
	You cannot re-assign it. 
				For BLOCK SCOPE: it is used a declarative. 
						You will never re-assign it within the block scope because you should not (or you will get an error). 
						Use "const" for a value that is immutable.
